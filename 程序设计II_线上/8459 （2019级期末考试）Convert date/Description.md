So Lisa can easily calculate which day of the year that each student born.（e.g., 2019.2.1 is the $32^{th}$ day of the year.） Now given the record of students' names and birthdays, besides one quired student name, please help Lisa calculate which day of the year that the student born. 

### Input Description
