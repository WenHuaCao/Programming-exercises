# [Loops]D. Liang 4.19 Printing numbers in a pyramid pattern

# Description
Write a program that reads an interger n, then display the n levels pyramid pattern.
For example, if n=4, the pattern is as follow:

```
                   1
              1    2    1
         1    2    4    2    1
    1    2    4    8    4    2    1
```

# Input
An integer n (1<=n<=8).

# Output
The n levels Pattern.  
You should specify the width of each number's print field to 5, justify the output to right.

**NOTE:**
1. There is **NO SPACE** at the end of each line.
2. There is **A NEWLINE \(\\n\)** at the end of last line.

That is \(`.` indicates &lt;space&gt; and `¬` indicates \&lt;newline&gt;\)
```

.....1....2....1¬
