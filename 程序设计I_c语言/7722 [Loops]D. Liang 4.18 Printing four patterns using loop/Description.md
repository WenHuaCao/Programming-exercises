# [Loops]D. Liang 4.18 Printing four patterns using loop

# Description
Write a program that reads two intergers p(1<=p<=4) and n(3<=n<=10), then display one of the following patterns.

For example, when n = 6, the outputs are as follow: 

Pattern 1
```
  1
  1  2
  1  2  3
  1  2  3  4
  1  2  3  4  5
  1  2  3  4  5  6
```
Pattern 2
```
  1  2  3  4  5  6
  1  2  3  4  5
  1  2  3  4
  1  2  3
  1  2
  1
```
Pattern 3
```
                 1
              1  2
           1  2  3
        1  2  3  4
     1  2  3  4  5
  1  2  3  4  5  6
```
Pattern 4
```
  1  2  3  4  5  6
     1  2  3  4  5
        1  2  3  4
           1  2  3
              1  2
                 1
 ```
## Input
two integers, p (1<=p<=4) and n (3<=n<=10).
 
## Output
Pattern p.

You should specify the width of each number's print field to 3, justify the output to right.

There is no extra space at the end of a line.

## Sample Input
```
1 6
```
## Sample Output
```
  1
  1  2
  1  2  3
  1  2  3  4
  1  2  3  4  5
  1  2  3  4  5  6
```
